# Hangman_Game

This is my first C project. In this project, my collaborator was Mehedi Al Murteja.

    Game Rules : 
    
    1. You have to guess the letter of the word one by one
    2. You will get 6 wrong chances for every word.
    3. You can skip a word by typing 'skip' only 3 times.
    4. If you complete 10 words, you'll win.
    5. If you want to kill the man,just type 'kill' and game will end. (But your earned score will be 0)

## If you don't want to face any technical errors, read all the Details and README files in the folders.
